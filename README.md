## Adding a New Command

If you'd like to add a new command to the bot, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new command class** that inherits from the `Command` class.
    - Implement the `execute()` method to handle the command's logic.
    - Optionally, implement a `validate()` method to validate input arguments.
    - Make sure its in the rigth category, or make a new one
    - Imports it to command_factory.py before COMMANDS dict

2. **Add the new command to the `COMMANDS` dictionary** in the `CommandFactory`.
    ```python
    COMMANDS: Dict[str, Command] = {
        "new_command": NewCommand(),  # Add your new command here
    }
    ```

3. **Add command handler**
    - Add the command to an existing message handler or a new one
    - If new one, creates its function to call the command_factory
    - Optionally, supply info with a send_message or monitor the command execution with log writer

4. **Test your command** to make sure everything works correctly.
